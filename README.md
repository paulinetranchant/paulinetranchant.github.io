I am currently a PhD Candidate at [BRAMS](http://www.brams.org). 
I conduct research on the cognitive mechanisms of rhythm perception and movement synchronization to music. I use machine learning to decode rhythm perception from brain signals. My methodologies mainly include behavioral testing, electroencephalography, and motion capture.
